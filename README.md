<i style="display: block; font-style: italic; font-size:15px;">dwin: API Response Caching for Python üöÄ</i>
</div>

## Details üöÄ
Welcome to **dwin**, a robust and lightweight caching library for Python, designed to enhance the performance and efficiency of your API interactions. Leveraging the simplicity and reliability of SQLite, Dwin provides a persistent, disk-based cache for API responses, making it an ideal choice for applications where quick and reliable data retrieval is crucial.



## Features üåü

- **Persistent API Response Caching**: Utilizes SQLite for durable, disk-based caching.
- **Automatic Cache Management**: Handles insertion, retrieval, and expiration of cache data seamlessly.
- **Easy to Integrate**: Designed to be simple to set up and use within your existing Python applications.
- **Customizable Expiry Policy**: Allows for flexible cache expiration settings to suit various use cases.
- **Lightweight**: No heavy dependencies or complex server setups required.

## Getting Started üöÄ
Below you'll find a quick guide on how to get started with Dwin. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the full documentation.

### Installation 

Install Dwin using pip:

```bash
pip install dwin
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use Dwin to cache API responses:

```python
from dwin import DwinCache

# Create a cache instance
cache = DwinCache(db_path='path/to/your/cache.db')

# Fetch data with caching
url = "https://api.example.com/data"
response = cache.fetch(url)
print(response)


```

### Advanced Usage üõ†

`dwin` also supports advanced features like custom expiration times, namespace partitioning, and more. Here's how you can leverage these features:

```python
from dwin import DwinCache

# Initialize the cache with a custom expiration time (in seconds)
cache = DwinCache(db_path='path/to/your/cache.db', expire_after=1800)

# Manually managing cache
cache.set('custom_key', 'Cached content')
cached_content = cache.get('custom_key')
print(cached_content)


```

## TODO List üóÇÔ∏è
Initial Setup and Planning:
- [x] **Set up a new Git repository for the project.**
- [x] **Create a virtual environment and set up initial Python project structure.**
- [ ] **Define the library's API and design interface.**

## Core Development Tasks:
- [ ] **Implement SQLite database integration for caching:**
  - [ ] Set up SQLite database schema for caching.
  - [ ] Develop functions for inserting, fetching, and deleting cache entries.
  - [ ] Implement cache expiration and automatic cleanup of old entries.
- [ ] **Develop the core caching logic:**
  - [ ] Create a function to check the cache before making an API call.
  - [ ] Implement logic to cache new API responses.
  - [ ] Ensure thread safety for read/write operations to the cache.
- [ ] **Integrate `httpx` for making HTTP requests within the library.**
- [ ] **Utilize `pydantic` for response validation and data modeling.**

## Testing and Documentation:
- [ ] **Write unit tests for all major functionality:**
  - [ ] Test SQLite database operations.
  - [ ] Test caching logic and expiration.
  - [ ] Test HTTP request functionality and error handling.
- [ ] **Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to run tests automatically.**
- [ ] **Create comprehensive documentation:**
  - [ ] Write a clear, concise README file.
  - [ ] Document all public functions and classes.
  - [ ] Provide examples of common use cases and workflows.

## Additional Features and Improvements:
- [ ] **Implement advanced caching strategies (e.g., LRU cache).**
- [ ] **Add support for asynchronous API calls.**
- [ ] **Provide configuration options for:**
  - [ ] Customizing database file location.
  - [ ] Setting global cache expiration times.
  - [ ] Configuring automatic cleanup intervals.
- [ ] **Optimize performance for high-load scenarios.**

## Community and Distribution:
- [ ] **Set up a contributing guide and code of conduct for the project.**
- [ ] **Create issue templates and pull request templates for GitHub.**
- [ ] **Package and publish the library to PyPI.**
- [ ] **Promote the library in relevant online communities and social media.**

## Maintenance and Support:
- [ ] **Monitor and address issues reported by users.**
- [ ] **Regularly update dependencies to maintain compatibility and security.**
- [ ] **Plan and implement new features based on user feedback.**

Remember, this list is a guideline. It's expected to evolve over time as the project develops and grows.
